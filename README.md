## Deployment

The front is hosted on https://main--loquacious-zuccutto-671d0a.netlify.app/

And the back is hosted on https://esum-acisum-server.herokuapp.com/

## The Esum Acisum API

I created an API for the website.
It is a REST API that serves data in JSON format and is hosted on: https://esum-acisum-api.herokuapp.com/

For the moment it only serves the data about chords progressions, but in the future it will serve more data.

## About the Development

The website is developed with React and the back is developed with Node.js and Express.js and in both I used TypeScript.

For the state management I used Recoil and native React state API like useState, useEffect and custom hooks when needed.

For the styling I used Style Components and to manage a global theme I created a theme system with TypeScript.
